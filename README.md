![analytics-1030x618](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f868ac39-5b31-4a62-b224-def03c3b61c2)

This project explores a synthetic HR dataset using **advanced SQL techniques** to answer 20 real-world HR business questions. The goal is to uncover insights on employee attrition, performance, salary, tenure, and promotion trends.


## üìå Problem Statement

Companies often face challenges in understanding workforce patterns and retention risks. The goal of this project is to perform SQL-based analysis on an HR dataset to extract valuable insights that can inform HR policies and decision-making.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **Window Functions**
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Aggregate & Conditional Functions**
- **Date Functions**

---

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 300+ synthetic employee records with attributes such as:

- `employee_id`, `name`, `department`, `job_role`
- `salary`, `performance_rating`, `attrition`
- `hire_date`, `last_promotion_date`, `age`, `location`, `education_level`

---

## üîç Key Business Questions Solved

## 1. What is the attrition rate per department?
```sql
select department,
count(*) as total_emp,
count(case when attrition = 'Yes' then 1 end) as attrition_count,
(count(case when attrition = 'Yes' then 1 end)*100.0)/count(*) as attrition_percentage 
from hr_data
group by department;

```
